# Problems-on-DSA
Problems on DSA is designed and selected  by Sachin sir for different topics.

Here, the problems are based on diffrent difficulty level which will be uploaded class move on, These problems are 
basic to standard level so that we will quench our thrist by solving these problems.

**Tips** :

Solve these problem first and try to come with (at least) brute force solution, find the time complexity of brute force then go ahead to 
minimise it. during this period of time if you stuck more then 1-2hrs, lookup for the hint and read all theoritical knowledge about algorithm,
concept, etc which is used in those porblems.

if you still not able to implement optimal solution then go to solution also always think about how to minimise 
time-complexity. it will lead you to the ultimate answer.

#Remember: **Practice Practice and Practice is the only key of CP.**
