# **Hashing Questions** 
A Hash table is an effective data structure for implementing Dictionary. A Dictionary is a data structure that maps key to value.
Hash Table and Hash Function is used to understand theoritical concept behind Hashing.
 # implementing Hash
  
  C++, java, and python uses unordered_map, HashMap, and Dictionary respectively.

# Time-complexity Analysis
 **Average case** time complexity for search is `O(1)`
 **Worst case** time complexity for lookup(Search) is `O(n)`
 ``Note``: worst case is rarely implemented. 

# **C++**

1) **unordered_map<int,int>hash;** 
2) Adding a Key, value pair
**hash.insert(key,value);**
3) Find the value for key=key
**if(hash.find(k)==hash.end()) return null;
else return hash[k];**
